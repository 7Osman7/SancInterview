# SancInterview

There are four components to this repository:

- Finals folder: this is a fork of the repository used for the integration/finals demonstration of Robocup@Home Education competition. This was used to make the turtlebot act like a resturant server, accepting voice commands, go to the kitchen area, picking up the order, and going back to the person
- MECH 305 Report: this is a report that includes both analysis and the code (in the appendices) used for binary supervised classifiers to predict rain in an AUS city. This was part of a ML project that I chose for one of my courses
- : this is the person following script used for the turtlebot as a standalone file. It finds the face you ask it to find, and follows the body, stopping with voice commands
- EECE571T folder: not yet updated as the project is still incomplete, will update as soon as I have something to demonstrate (if you are interested)


Please let me know if you require more demonstration or if you have any specific questions about any of the work mentioned above and I will be happy to answer
