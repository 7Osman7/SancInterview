# SancInterview

There are four components to this repository:

- Finals folder: this is a fork of the repository used for the integration/finals demonstration of Robocup@Home Education competition 
- MECH 305 Tutorial 8: this is a report that includes both analysis and the code used (in the appendices)
- : this is the person following script we used for the turtlebot as a standalone file
- EECE571T folder: not yet updated as the project is still incomplete, will update as soon as I have something to demonstrate (if you are interested)


Please let me know if you require more demonstration or if you have any specific questions about any of the work mentioned above
